title: "556"
description: "Domain does not accept mail"

This specification adds the 556 reply code to the repertoire
specified in SMTP.  When an intermediate SMTP system (typically a
relay) that would normally attempt to open a mail connection to a
host referred to in a forward-pointing address can determine that the
host does not accept mail connections, and do so without attempting
to open a connection to that target host, it is appropriate for it to
return a reply with a 556 code to the system that sent it the message
for outbound transmission.  Interpretation of a special DNS record,
found when a lookup is performed in conjunction with a RCPT command,
is one such method (and the only standardized one at the time
this specification was written).

When an SMTP server returns a 556 reply code after receiving a
command (such as RCPT, which contains a forward-pointing address)
because it has information (such as discussed above) that the mail
will not be accepted, the SMTP client is expected to handle the
response like any other permanent negative completion reply to the
command.  This is consistent with the SMTP specification.
